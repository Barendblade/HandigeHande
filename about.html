                        <p>I’m a 17-year-old passionate about nature and working with my hands. I specialize in
                            woodworking and enjoy fixing things. I aim to build something impactful in the agricultural
                            industry, with a love for motorbikes driving my ambition.</p>

                        <p>
                            I’m Albert, a 17-year-old with a passion for chess, coding, and entrepreneurship. I love the
                            thrill of building things, whether it’s a new website, a business idea, or a personal
                            project. I'm also into ethical hacking and coding, always looking for ways to improve my
                            skills and push my limits. My journey is all about blending my interests, learning new
                            things, and constantly hustling to turn ideas into reality.</p>
